Coming out of my comfort zone, I'm finally putting my thoughts and opinions in public. 

** Trust me I'm dying inside :( **

I consider myself a jack of all trades and a master of none.

I NEVER just want to be a master of one.

### Read

* non-fiction

* fiction (science fiction mostly)

* finance (mutual funds and stocks)

### Write

* poetry
  
* tech (OSS, System Design and Distributed Systems)

* personal finance
  
* self-development 
  
* of course, my favorite rap bars.
